#data structure is a way to structure data (eg. list,set, distionary e.t.c)
#another one this  ways is a stack 

stack = []
stack.append("item 1")
stack.append("item 2")
print(stack.pop())  #the latest item added gets removed first just like a stack of books, to remove an item from 
                    #you remove from the top before the bottom
