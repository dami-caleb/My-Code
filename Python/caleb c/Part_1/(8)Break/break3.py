#the pass does not affect your code in any way
# anytime you are writing a line of code and something is needed but you don't
#know what to put there, you can type pass
#e.g
for language in languages:  
    pass                         #obviously something is needed here. If you dont't know what to put at the moment, writing "pass" will make it possible for you to leave it blank and without affecting the code
