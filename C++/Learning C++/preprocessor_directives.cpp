//Your code is preprocessed prior to compiling
//There are several directives addressed to the preprocessor 
//which contain information about what to add or remove in the code
//The compiler recives a modeified version of the code from the preprocessor
//Directives tell the preprocessor what to add or remove in the code
//Useful for libraries, constants, selecting code blocks, etc.
