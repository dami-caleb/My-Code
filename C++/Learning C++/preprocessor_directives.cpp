//Your code is preprocessed prior to compiling
//There are several directives addressed to the preprocessor 
//which contain information about what to add or remove in the code
//The compiler recives a modeified version of the code from the preprocessor
//Directives tell the preprocessor what to add or remove in the code
//Useful for libraries, constants, selecting code blocks, etc.

/*All directives start with the "#" charcter*/

//example
 #include <iostream> //The "#inculde directive here replaces all the line "e.g. #include <stdlib.h> with the file itself (Yes! all that files is represented with just the #include directive)" 
 //Notice that iostream does not have a path or extension. Also notice that it is enclosed in angled brackets. That means that the file will be searched in a predefined location, usually 
 //specified by the development environment, like a default include folder.
